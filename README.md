## How to Use

3. Where provided, replace any `[ ]` placeholders with the option provided, and any `< >` placeholders with your specific details.
4. Use the prompt with your LLM tool with the context of your task.

### Categories

- [Content Writing](Content-Writing.md)
  - This category includes a collection of prompts for generating content ideas, writing new content, summarizing research, and editing to generate high-quality content.

## Tips

### Microsoft Copilot

- **Using the current web page as context**: If you're using Copilot in Edge, the Copilot sidebar panel can be used to take the current web page as context. This can help Copilot generate relevant responses to your task. If you are using a personal account, this can be toggled in the message box by changing the **Using relevant sources** options to **Using this page**. If you are using a work or school account, prefix your prompt with "Using the current web page, " followed by your prompt.
