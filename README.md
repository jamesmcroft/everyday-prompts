## Recommended Tools

- [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/): ChatGPT is a versatile tool that can be used with all of the prompts in this collection. It has a larger context window than most other tools, making it ideal for working with long-form content. ChatGPT supports the generation of both text and images. Using ChatGPT+, you can also create your own GPTs for performing specific tasks using these prompts.
- [**Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/): Copilot is similar to ChatGPT, and includes a helpful sidebar integration in Microsoft Edge that can be used to interact with the current tab content as context for your prompts. The prompts are limited to 2,000 characters, however, Copilot provides a Notebook feature that can be used for larger context windows. Copilot supports the generation of text and images, and includes support for plugins. Copilot Pro provides additional features for creating your own Copilot GPTs similar to ChatGPT+.

## Tips

### Microsoft Copilot

- **Using the current web page as context**: If you're using Copilot in Edge, the Copilot sidebar can be used to take the current web page as context. This can help Copilot generate relevant responses to your task. If you are using a personal account, this can be toggled in the message box by changing the **Using relevant sources** options to **Using this page**. If you are using a work or school account, prefix your prompt with "Using the current web page, " followed by your prompt.
