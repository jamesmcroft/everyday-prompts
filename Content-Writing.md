## Creating a feature image for a blog post

Visual content is essential for engaging readers. The feature image should be visually appealing and relevant to the content you are writing.

Instead of a prompt, this section provides a set of guidelines to help you craft a tailored prompt for your needs. An example is provided to illustrate how you can structure your request.

**Guidelines:**

- Describe what you want the image to convey (e.g., a concept, a metaphor, a visual representation of the content).
- Specific the style of the image (e.g., abstract, realistic, minimalist).
- Mention any specific elements that should be included in the image (e.g., icons, text, people).
- Provide any color or composition preferences you have for the image.

**Example:**

```text
Create a feature image for a blog post based on the following description:

- Concept: A representation of effective marketing strategies for small businesses.
- Style: Minimalistic with no text.
- Elements: Include people working together, a graph showing growth, and a laptop with social media icons.
